## MERN Stack Practice
### Introduction
This repository is dedicated to practicing the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack from basic JavaScript concepts. It provides a foundation for learning and experimenting with full-stack web development using popular technologies.

### Technologies Used
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend API.
React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
JavaScript: Programming language used across the stack.
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for front-end development.
Features
Backend Development: Learn to build RESTful APIs with Express.js and Node.js.
Frontend Development: Practice building interactive user interfaces with React.js.
Database Integration: Understand how to connect and interact with MongoDB from the backend.
Full-Stack Development: Gain experience in developing both frontend and backend components of web applications.
